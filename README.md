# QuickImage2
## Eclipse plugin for browsing images

The QuickImage2 plugin provides an eclipse-editor for viewing images. You can browse images one by one, or all as thumbnails.
Use the toolbar to navigate or by single- or double-clicking the images. By default QuickImage associates its editor with: .bmp, .cur, .dcx, .gif, .ico, .incs, .jpeg, .jpg, .pam, .pbm, .pcx, .pgm, .pict, .png, .pnm, .ppm, .psd, .sgi, .svg, .tga, .tif, .tiff, .webp, .xpm, .xwd

modified to work with latest eclipse and uses the twelvemonkey image library on top of the eclipse image support
