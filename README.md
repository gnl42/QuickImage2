# QuickImage2
## Eclipse plugin for browsing images

The QuickImage2 plugin provides an eclipse-editor for viewing images. You can browse images one by one, or all as thumbnails.
Use the toolbar to navigate or by single- or double-clicking the images. By default QuickImage associates its editor with .gif .jpg .jpeg .png .bmp .ico

modified to work with latest eclipse and used the twelvemonkey image library instead of the eclipse image support
